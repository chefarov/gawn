# TODO

## For v0.4.0
* Option to blast only transcripts that were found in the transcriptome (faster)
* Compare with annotation from a good species that has both a genome and a
  transcriptome
* Add test dataset on GitHub `gawn_test_dataset` with small genome and transcriptome

## Later
- Carry the e-values into the transcriptome and genome annotation tables
- Change gene names in GFF3 from ORF to actual gene names from swissprot
